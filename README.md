This project implements an AI-powered educational chatbot that integrates sentiment analysis to enhance the learning experience. Built using the Llama 2 model and Hugging Face's sentiment analysis pipeline, the chatbot dynamically adjusts its responses based on the detected sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative). If the user is frustrated, the chatbot simplifies explanations and offers encouragement. When users are positive, the chatbot provides praise and advanced learning opportunities. This adaptive approach makes the chatbot more interactive, responsive, and suited to personalized learning environments. It is designed to assist users in real-time with various subjects, ensuring an engaging and empathetic experience.
